This page documents only processing of latex sources to create pdf files.

Latex documents are processed using miktex/TeXworks with pdflatex+makeindex+bibtex option.

Some plots are created using octave 4.0.3. 
Actual plot commands can be found in m-files in octave directory.

## Conversion of latex documents 

As advanced latex features are used, proper conversion to other formats than pdf does not produce good quality.

article.rtf is sample based on 15.10.2016 version of article.pdf
converted using http://www.pdfonline.com/pdf-to-word-converter/

Both latex2rtf and tex4ht fail during conversion
